Vending Machine Project

Using React, Java Spark, Maven, and nodeJS.

  To run this project please ensure NodeJS and Java is installed on your computer, then do the following: 

  1. Clone this repo. 

  2. Open the Project in IntelliJ and build Project (Ctrl + F9).

  3. Navigate src > main > java > app > main and run Main.java to start backend.

  4. The front end is located in root > FrontEnd.

  5. Navigate there and run npm build.

  6. In the same folder, run npm start.

  7. Once both the back end and front are working, navigate to "http://localhost:3000/"

Improvements I would make

  1. Restocking the machine displays the number of items being added or even a form.
  
  2. Item cannot be sold when there is a negative number of stock.
  
  3. Testing for the backend.
  
  4. I would have liked to used Redux to manage state Globally, it got a bit confusing passing state amongst components.
  
  5. Create smaller React components ie individual Button component.
  
  6. I would like to further experiment with the best way to perform Async requests.
  
  7. Stylize the front end.
